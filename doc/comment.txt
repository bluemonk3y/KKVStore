1. need to delete topic/stream/table
2. need to script up insert json, csv etc content
3. How does the internal command queue distribute tasks to remote workers? does it key by command - look at CommandStore.commandProducer
// look at io.confluent.ksql.rest.server.resources.KsqlResource for command execution
// commands executed in KsqlParser.buildAst
// edit sqlbase.g4 for language

// hacked into CommandRunner. private void executeStatement(String statementStr, CommandId commandId)
// to handle Stream
INSERT INTO <tweets_topics> (ID,NAME,AGE,ADDRESS,SALARY) VALUES (1, 'Ramesh', 32, 'Ahmedabad', 2000.00 );
